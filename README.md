# Chatbot Project

This is a chatbot application built using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. The backend is hosted using FastAPI and deployed on Vercel, while the frontend is built using React with Vite for fast development. The application uses the Gemini API to answer user queries and computes TF-IDF similarity search using `sklearn` to fetch relevant data from the database.
